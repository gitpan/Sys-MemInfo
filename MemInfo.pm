Sys::MemInfo - Memory informations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sys::MemInfo qw(totalmem freemem totalswap);

  print "total memory: ".(&totalmem / 1024)."\n";
  print "free memory:  ".(&freemem / 1024)."\n";

  print "total swap: ".(&totalswap / 1024)."\n";
  print "free swap:  ".(Sys::MemInfo::get("freeswap") / 1024)."\n";

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item availkeys

Return list of all accessor keys (freemem, totalmem, etc.)  This is useful
for dumping out all known information from the object by calling get() on
all of the returned keys.

=item freemem

Returns free physical memory in bytes.

=item freeswap

Returns free swap space in bytes.

=item get

Returns the value of the passed key.

=item totalmem

Returns total physical memory size in bytes.

=item totalswap
